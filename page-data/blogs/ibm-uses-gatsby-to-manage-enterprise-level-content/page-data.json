Big Website.\n\n![carbon](http://localhost:1337/uploads/carbon_fd6c844f3d.png)\n\nWhen IBM, one of the biggest companies in the world, went looking for a solution to help them manage a vast website, they found Gatsby. Carbon Design System is the open source library for all IBM software products. That’s all IBM software – which means the Carbon Design System website has hundreds of pages and more than a dozen developers, designers, and non-technical content contributors. IBM is one of the biggest companies in the world. And that was the problem – so much content led to a site that was difficult to optimize for performance. They needed to launch a refreshed website dedicated to product design requirements for all IBM-related product launches that worked as smart, fast, and reliably as IBM.\n\nThe original site was a home-grown static site based on Markdown and React that was complicated to update. Add to that many, many hands and minds working on it constantly – some with technical experience and some without. The large volume of content and content creators made it difficult to accomplish the main business objective for the website, which was to make it easy for anyone to contribute content, regardless of their level of technical ability.\n\nThe main goals for the new site were simple:\n\nA faster and easier site that anyone could update – even if they didn’t know how to code\nGood documentation – if anyone leaves the project, all the documentation is there, which eliminates the need to search around for how it was created.\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ibm-uses-gatsby-to-manage-enterprise-level-content"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2874580956"]}
